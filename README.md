# XBC2ModelDecomp
A reformatted fork of a [project created by daemon1](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18087) on the XeNTaX forums. All credit to them and to [PredatorCZ/Lukas Cone](https://lukascone.wordpress.com/2018/05/06/xenoblade-chronicles-import-tool/) for reversing the various model formats.
## Compiling
Other than the zlib library, everything should be stock System packages.
## Running
I've made a [short tutorial](https://youtu.be/CaulBUh5e5c) on how to run it but it should honestly be easy to figure out. It's a form application, so you have graphics and everything. It also fits on 600x800 monitors if you're insane enough to try it!'
